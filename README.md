# Study Notes

## Metrics Overview

### What is metric?
- A metric is a quantitative measure used to evalueate the performance of an AI application.

- Helps in assessing how well the application is relatively to the given test dataset

- Provide a numerical basis for comparison, optimization and decision-making

- Essential for component selection, error diagnosis and continuous monitoring

### What are the different types of metrics?
- Metrics can be classified into two categories **based on the mechanism used underneath the hood**:
    - LLM-based metrics
    - Non-LLM-based metrics

- Metrics can be classified into two categories **based on the type of data they evaluate**:
    - Single turn metrics
    - Multi turn metrics


### What are the design principle?
- Are a set of core principles to ensure reliability, interpretability and relevance

### Explain Single-Aspect Focus principle
A single metric should target only one specific aspect of the AI application's performance

### Explain Intuitive and Interpretable principle
Metrics should be designed to be easy to understand and interpret

### Explain Effective Prompt Flows principle
When developing metrics using large language models (LLMs), use intelligent prompt flows that align closely with human evaluation

### Explain Robustness principle
When developing metrics using large language models (LLMs), use intelligent prompt flows that align closely with human evaluation

### Explain Consistent Scoring Ranges principle
When developing metrics using large language models (LLMs), use intelligent prompt flows that align closely with human evaluation
